# FruitGAN: Exploring human concepts with Generative Adversarial Networks
This repository contains the majority of the code used to run the experiments exploring human concepts detailed in the [report](https://app.box.com/s/lpe0mnm1k1c85ken4cmnkw9c2jqhq3ov). This report details the work and research completed for my final year project at The University of Edinburgh.

### Abstract

Cognitive science seeks to understand a variety of mental phenomena, one of which
is the representation of concepts in the human mind. This project focuses on the
representations of concepts within a naturally learnt category. Two methods of uncovering these category representations is Gibbs sampling with people (GSP), which
stems from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. These methods can be
used in an experimental setting to uncover people’s category representations. As these
methods function optimally when the stimulus space is parameterised and continuous,
it is a challenge to explore photo-realistic stimuli using these methods. This project
presents one solution to this problem by using generative adversarial networks (GANs)
to generate continuous, photo-realistic stimuli, and a method called SeFa to parameterise the resulting space. This project implemented a generalised application to run
experiments on human participants using the GSP paradigm to uncover their category
representations, sampling from a continuous, parameterised, photo-realistic stimulus
space generated by a GAN. This application was tested by exploring fruit categories.
The results presented evidence that the application was successfully able to explore the
participants’ categories. Broadly, this project showed that there is potential for using
GANs to enhance the study of category representations, as well as for a generalised
application that would facilitate this research.
